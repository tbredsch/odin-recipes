    <h2>Another way to eat eggs that takes much more time and prep</h2>
    <p>Have you ever woken up in the morning and thought to yourself, "you know 
        what, I want breakfast but I want it to take longer and be more difficult
        than it needs to be...?"  Well then this recipe is for you!

        <li>Assortment of vegetables and meats</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

        <li>When the pan is warm place your egg/meat/veg mixture in the pan and cover with a lid</li>
